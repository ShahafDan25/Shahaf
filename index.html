                <h3> Let me tell you a little bit about me:</h3>
                <br>
                <h4> 
                    I am 22, and just recently graduated from <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Boston University</a> with a Bachelors in Computer Science. <br>
                    I am currently looking for a job in the Boston area as a Software Developer or Data Scientist.
                    <br><br>
                    I was born in Israel and moved to Livermore, California at the age of 15.5 with my 3 younger siblings and parents.
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Granada High School</a> in 2018 and in the top 5% of, where I was on the Cross Country, Wrestling, and Volleyball teams. 
                    <br><br>
                    I made the financially-responsible decision of attending a community college (<a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Las Positas College</a>), 
                    where while working almost full-time in internships and as a waiter, I have achieved much more than imagined 
                    (feel free to read about it <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    In the midst of the pandemic (2020), I transferred to <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Boston University</a> - a school with a rapidly growing Data Science program 
                    and a safe in-person plan through the pandemic for its students - allowing me to experience the "college experience" 
                    I never had in my time at Las Positas. <br>
                    I had recently graduated from BU and am now looking to get my foot into the industry.
                    <br><br>
                    I love playing basketball, and am a big warriors fan.
                    In my free time I love working on fun coding projects, watch TV (which I document <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>), travel and hike, take and edit photos (that I upload <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>), go out with friends, or read modern-philosophy books.
                    <br><br>
                    That was my attemp at keeping this as short as possible. <br>
                    I developed myself a blogging site (<a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("projects", self)'>shahafster</a>) so everyone who is interested can keep up with my life.

                    <h4> 
                        Inspired by the movie "The Social Network" where Zuckerberg blogged his experience through starting 'FaceMash' on 'Zuckonic' which I saw for the first time on the first day of COVID-19's official quarantine,
                        I had decided to take the opportunity of having additional free time towards developing my first site.
                        <br><br>
                        shahafster-001 was live and well from April until October of 2021. After deleting the site due to the fear of invasion of privacy (rushed move), I decided again in the following summer to re-develop a better version of the site.
                        <br><br>
                        shahafster-002 was born and became more secure and allowed a greater variety of features to allow a user-friendly use to anyone who was interested in keeping up with my life.

                        This is my photography site! 
                        <br><br>
                        My interest in photography first sparked in high school. In my junior year I dated a talented young photographer who was obssessed with her camera. <br>
                        She was very passionate about her hobby to the point where watching her enjoying it and some of the end-results sparked the interest in me as well.
                        <br><br>
                        I then took my dad's camera and started taking photos. After years of learning online, I have learned to edit my photos as well, which I upload all to this site.

                        As a dedicated lover of the film & television industry, I have vouched to document my criticism and thoughts of every show and movie I watch.
                        <br><br>
                        I started by just typing some data into a spreadsheet when I realize I can utilize my software dev. skills for this. <br>
                        I added a feature to my blog, <a class = "link" href = ""> shahafster </a>, that allows me to categorize and label each post into categories. Now, everytime I want to record my thoughts I simply type into my blog and label it under "film"
                        <br><br>
                        Haven't done so yet, but I intend on implementing a simple NLP algorithm to generate the ratings, genre, and simple summary of the movie. Of course I am going to have to record A LOT more movies before seeing viable results, but hey - every product strats with a funny idea.

                            Having graduated in May '22, all of a sudden June became surprisingly broing. I spent my time looking for DS & ML jobs in the Boston and NY area, while running across some pretty interesting APIs.
                            <br />
                            This project is the epitome of what a BU student with a BA in Computer Science and some experience can do with some data.
                            <br /> <br />
                            This project is a fully delopyed website. The front end was done using react and is connected via a flask backend to various REST APIs (using Python).
                            <br />
                            Some of the APIs used in the project include from NBA (
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_per_game.html">Players </a>, 
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://cdn.nba.com/stats/"> Actions</a>),
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/"> Spotify</a>,
                                <a class = "link" href= "http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/"> Yahoo Finance</a>,
                                and more.
                            <br /> <br />
                            For every API used, there are two main files within the GitHub Open Source Code I share: <strong>retrieve.py</strong> and <strong>analyze.ipynb</strong>
                            <br />
                            Those files are documented and commented very carefully and in a user-friendly manner to allow more developers to learn from the use of those APIs and to ease the process of retrieving and analyzing data on other developers.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Some of the DS & ML methods I was hoping to demonstrate include the use of <strong>Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> (Isolation Forrests, Outlier Factors), <strong>Classification Methods </strong> (SVM, KNN), <strong>Predictions</strong>, and more.

                            I developed shahafster as a blogging sites where I could throw my thoughts into a blank sheet of paper while controlilng my own data.

                            The site allows for people to sign up (with my approval) to get private content of my life, as well as like my posts. <br>
                            As the site had evolved, it became to my private social media that is updated multiple times per day.
                            <br /> <br />
                            The site includes tag recognition, post filters, label, Natural Language Processing, and some back end Data Science as well.
                            <br /> It is run on a private server, hashed, and was designed and a relation SQL datamodel.

                            As a hackathon lover, building a website or a program from scratch every time I went to a hackathon became rather exhausting.
                            <br /> As a solution, I created shahaf.css. A css library that allowed me to re-use css code per my own designe in the use of HTML classes.

                            The project resembles Bootstrap in its idea, only I use my own design and classes here and no element is automatically defined in anyway without proper class assignment.

                            The Market is a monthly event held by the Las Positas College Student Government. 
                            <br /> <br />
                            In collaboration with the county's food bank, basic groceries are served to the community throughout an entire day.
                            <br /> The event is organized by the Student Government but includes volunteers from various student organizations.
                            <br /> <br />
                            As a constant volunteer, I noticed the inventory, volunteer sign-ups, and registration form are managed poorly and ineffectively.
                            <br /> <br />
                            I designed a software to allow Student Government to manage the periodical event with more confidence. 
                            <br /> In the software, volunteers could sign ahead of time, create their own account, and see when volunteers are needed as well as the times their friend volunteered.
                            <br /> Additionally, inventory and leftover groceries could now be tracked via a software with user friendly data analysis graphics instead of pen and paper. 
                            <br />The software  would also generate PDF reports to be submitted to the county's food bank of proper grocery use (per their request) regarding which groceries' supply needs to be increased or decreased.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Lastly, attendees at the Market are requested to sign up per arrival, which was done on google form without proper management of the data. 
                            <br />The software allowed to sign up online ahead of time and simply provide their 
                            email address upon arrival, rather than a 5-minute long repetetive sign up process.
                            <br /> <br /> 
                            The software today is used officially by the school and is running on the its servers under IT supervision and maintenance.
