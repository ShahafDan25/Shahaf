                        I am a Junior (third-year) student at Boston University, and currently seek internships in Boston, MA as a full-stack web/software developer

                                The Market is a monthly service, ran and managed by the Las Positas College Student Government [LPCSG]. In the event, the student government collaborates with the Alameda County's Food Bank to distribute free groceries to the students and anyone from the surrounding communities. <br> <br>
                                As I volunteer monthly in the event, I noticed the management system is extremely inefficient and time consuming, mainly to the lack of automation and technological optimization. <br><br>
                                As a young software developer, I develop a manegement web-app on a closed server using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap API's for the front end user interface, and PHP for the back end with embedded MySQL queries in accordance to the designated database I created.<br><br>
                                The software has significantly improved the management of the service. It provides the users with tools such as sign up sheets for volunteers (and user registration), admin report generation for each market both in PDF fprmat (using FPDF library) and in HTML format with graphics to illustrate statistics (using Morris.js), the option to manage effectively the inventory of each market occurence, and a user-friendly registration form. <br><br>
                                Additionally, the software assists with the analysis of data to increase the rates of attendance, describe when volunteers are needed the most, and more.

                                BrainStorm is an inter-collegiate online tool specified for community college student, with the simple objective of helping students navigate a better and more effective path towards their transfer to a 4 year institution. <br><br>
                                It provides students with the opportunity to compare classes from different community colleges (based on a location and specified radius) which will allow them to choose the best class that would fit their learning style from a variety of community coleges. <br><br>
                                The site was born from the need to carefully select classes in an era where online-learning is incredibly significant and powerful. Student will have the oppotunity to ask difference students from other community colleges as well as alumnis about their transfer experience, and what academic path do they recommend the most. <br><br>

                                FeedBack is a project with an enormours potential. It is a social media for all entreprenuers and developers.
                                <br>
                                FeedBack supplies innovators from all ends of the globe a platform through which they can get feedback and contructive critism on the ideas. FeedBack was born out of the realization that many innovations, inevntions, and entreprenuerships today are based on ideas without a need, and therefore many of them fail. FeedBack's mission if to help young entreprenuers, developers, and innovators, to improve and prefect their ideas based on the needs and feedback of the public.
                                <br><br>
                                Feedback provides a platform through which members can share their ideas (safely under terms of membership and copyrights agreements) and get feedback, as well as provide feedback to other users.
                                Each member's evaluator rating will increase based on the amount of feedbacks given and the validity of the feedback (which will be given to the comment from the innovator to whom the idea belongs).
                                <br><br>
                                Members can gather in groups or individually to create new ideas as well as share it across all social media platforms and gain publicity easily.
                                <br><br> Additionally, Feedback allows investors to register as investor and buy stocks, equity, or donate money to certain companies or products they find on the platform.

                                In these confusing times, under the COVID-19 pandemic, many college students are uncertain and terrified of attending in-person classes.
                                <br><br> 
                                COVIDist is a platform I plan on developing throughout the months of September - October which will allow students in Boston University to act and socialize safely during the pandemic.
                                <br><br>
                                COVIDist allows students to gather within small groups and social-bubble in them, as well as track each person's COVID's test results ( which are taken every 72 hours on campus).
                                <br><br>
                                Members have the options to share their location, request friends for bringing food to their place, as well as to gather in communities for playing sports, and going outdoors in groups (as long as all members are tested negative in the last 72 hours - according to their testimonial in the platform).
