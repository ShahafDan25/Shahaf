                <h3> Let me tell you a little bit about me:</h3>
                <br>
                <h4> 
                    I am 22, and just recently graduated from <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Boston University</a> with a Bachelors in Computer Science. <br>
                    I am currently looking for a job in the Boston area as a Software Developer or Data Scientist.
                    <br><br>
                    I was born in Israel and moved to Livermore, California at the age of 15.5 with my 3 younger siblings and parents.
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Granada High School</a> in 2018 and in the top 5% of, where I was on the Cross Country, Wrestling, and Volleyball teams. 
                    <br><br>
                    I made the financially-responsible decision of attending a community college (<a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Las Positas College</a>), 
                    where while working almost full-time in internships and as a waiter, I have achieved much more than imagined 
                    (feel free to read about it <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    In the midst of the pandemic (2020), I transferred to <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>Boston University</a> - a school with a rapidly growing Data Science program 
                    and a safe in-person plan through the pandemic for its students - allowing me to experience the "college experience" 
                    I never had in my time at Las Positas. <br>
                    I had recently graduated from BU and am now looking to get my foot into the industry.
                    <br><br>
                    I love playing basketball, and am a big warriors fan.
                    In my free time I love working on fun coding projects, watch TV (which I document <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>), travel and hike, take and edit photos (that I upload <a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("academics", self)'>here</a>), go out with friends, or read modern-philosophy books.
                    <br><br>
                    That was my attemp at keeping this as short as possible. <br>
                    I developed myself a blogging site (<a class = "link" onclick = 'roll_to_section("projects", self)'>shahafster</a>) so everyone who is interested can keep up with my life.

                            Having graduated in May '22, all of a sudden June became surprisingly broing. I spent my time looking for DS & ML jobs in the Boston and NY area, while running across some pretty interesting APIs.
                            <br />
                            This project is the epitome of what a BU student with a BA in Computer Science and some experience can do with some data.
                            <br /> <br />
                            This project is a fully delopyed website. The front end was done using react and is connected via a flask backend to various REST APIs (using Python).
                            <br />
                            Some of the APIs used in the project include from NBA (
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_per_game.html">Players </a>, 
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://cdn.nba.com/stats/"> Actions</a>),
                                <a class = "link" href= "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/"> Spotify</a>,
                                <a class = "link" href= "http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/"> Yahoo Finance</a>,
                                and more.
                            <br /> <br />
                            For every API used, there are two main files within the GitHub Open Source Code I share: <strong>retrieve.py</strong> and <strong>analyze.ipynb</strong>
                            <br />
                            Those files are documented and commented very carefully and in a user-friendly manner to allow more developers to learn from the use of those APIs and to ease the process of retrieving and analyzing data on other developers.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Some of the DS & ML methods I was hoping to demonstrate include the use of <strong>Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> (Isolation Forrests, Outlier Factors), <strong>Classification Methods </strong> (SVM, KNN), <strong>Predictions</strong>, and more.
