        <p>
          I live in New York City and work as a Data Scientist in resinsurance. 
          
          <br />
          <br />
          
          I was born in Israel, moved to California, studied in Boston, and now face the next chapter in the jungle of concrete.
                    
          <br />
          <br />

          In my free time I try to read, write, explore, and scavenge the city for the moments worth capturing on camera.

          <br />
          <br />

          For a while now I have been pondering the meaning of life, and am now trying to work on something worth dedicating it to.
          
          <br />
          <br />

          Stay tuned for more to come.
